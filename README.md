# Profit Taker Analytics app

The Profit Taker Analytics project is designed to enhance the experience for Profit Taker speedrunners in Warframe by providing an advanced analyzer with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). This project builds upon an existing simple command line application, transforming it into a sophisticated tool that bridges the gap between textual data and intuitive visual representation.

The original command line application offered essential parsing capabilities, but it was limited to displaying information in a text format. The Profit Taker Analytics project elevates this functionality by introducing a seamlessly integrated GUI, enabling users to interact with the data effortlessly. This enhancement facilitates clear communication between the parser and the application, resulting in a more comprehensive and user-friendly tool.
