# Profit Taker Analytics Parser

The Profit Taker Analytics Parser is a tool designed to extract data from `EE.log` files generated by the game Warframe, located in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Warframe`. It processes these logs to extract valuable information about in-game runs and saves them into a structured JSON format. Additionally, it sets up a localhost API, enabling seamless integration with other applications or services.

## Features

- **Log Parsing** : Parses `EE.log` files to extract detailed information about in-game runs.
- **JSON Output** : Saves the extracted data into a JSON file for easy access and analysis.
- **Localhost API** : Sets up a local API endpoint to allow external access to the parsed data.

## Usage

1. Ensure that Warframe generates `EE.log` files in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Warframe`.
2. Run the Profit Taker Analytics Parser.
3. Access the parsed data via the localhost API endpoint.
