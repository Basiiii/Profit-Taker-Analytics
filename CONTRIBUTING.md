# Contributing to Profit Taker Analytics

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Profit Taker Analytics**! We greatly appreciate your enthusiasm and willingness to help improve our project. However, please note that due to security concerns, certain parts of the codebase (specifically the **Application Component**) are not visible or shareable.

While this limitation may affect the scope of contributions, the **Rust Core Component** is open-source and we encourage contributions to this part of the project.

## How to Contribute

We value contributions in various forms, including bug reports, feature requests, code enhancements, documentation improvements, and translations. Here's a brief guide on how you can contribute:

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug or unexpected behavior, please open a GitHub issue. Include detailed information about the issue, such as steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.

### Requesting Features

Have an idea for a new feature or enhancement? Open a GitHub issue to discuss and describe the proposed feature, its use case, and any relevant information.

### Code Contributions

As the **Application Component** is proprietary and not open-source, most code contributions will focus on the **Rust Core Component**.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix related to the **Rust Core Component**.
3. Make changes and commit them with clear, concise messages.
4. Push changes to your fork.
5. Submit a pull request to the main repository.

Before submitting a pull request:

- Adhere to the project's coding style and conventions.
- Include tests for your changes if applicable.
- Update the documentation as needed.

### Documentation Contributions

Improvements to documentation are always welcome. If you find typos, unclear wording, or missing information, submit a pull request to enhance the documentation.

### Translation Contributions

We offer many languages on our app. If you'd like to contribute translations to the app, please contact Basi through email at `hello.basi@proton.me` or via Discord: `basi__`.
