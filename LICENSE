**Profit Taker Analytics**

The **Profit Taker Analytics** project consists of two completely separate components: the **Application Component** and the **Rust Core Component**. Each has distinct licensing terms and purposes.

### Application Component (Proprietary)
The **Application Component** (located in the `app` folder) is proprietary, and all rights are strictly reserved. Unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution of this component is expressly prohibited without explicit permission from the project owner **(Enrique Rodrigues (Basi))**. This ensures full control over its distribution and usage, protecting the intellectual property contained within the application.

### Rust Core Component (Open Source - GPL-3.0)
The **Rust Core Component** (located in the `rust_core` folder) is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)**. This portion of the project consists of a Rust-based core that serves as a Flutter Rust FFI library. It enables FFI (Foreign Function Interface) calls from Dart to Rust, primarily for parsing runs and managing data storage in a database.

By licensing the **Rust Core Component** under GPL-3.0, we embrace open-source principles, encouraging community collaboration and further development. However, this open-source license applies **only** to the `rust_core` component and does not extend to the proprietary **Application Component**.
