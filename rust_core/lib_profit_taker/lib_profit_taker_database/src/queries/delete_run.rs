//! # Run Deletion Module  
//!  
//! This module provides functionality to delete a run from the database,  
//! ensuring that all related data is also removed if cascading delete rules are in place.  
//!  
//! ## Features  
//! - Deletes a run by its ID.  
//! - Uses SQLiteâ€™s cascading delete functionality to remove associated data.  
//! - Ensures safe execution by retrieving the global database path dynamically.  
//!  
//! ## Usage  
//! ```rust
//! use crate::queries::delete_run::delete_run;
//!
//! let run_id = 42;
//! if let Err(e) = delete_run(run_id) {
//!     eprintln!("Failed to delete run: {}", e);
//! }
//! ```  
//!  
//! ## Notes  
//! - The function relies on `get_db_path()` to retrieve the active database path.  
//! - Ensure that foreign key constraints are set up correctly in the database schema.

use crate::connection::get_db_path;

/// Deletes a run from the database, along with all related data.
///
/// # Arguments
/// - `run_id`: The ID of the run to delete.
///
/// # Returns
/// - `Ok(true)` if the run was successfully deleted.
/// - `Ok(false)` if no rows were deleted (meaning the run did not exist).
/// - An `Err` if there was an error executing the deletion query.
pub fn delete_run(run_id: i32) -> Result<bool> {
    // Retrieve the global database path
    let db_path = get_db_path()?;

    // Open a connection to the database
    let conn = Connection::open(&db_path)?;

    // Prepare and execute the delete query
    let affected_rows = conn.execute("DELETE FROM runs WHERE id = ?", [&run_id])?;

    // If no rows were affected, it means the run didn't exist
    if affected_rows == 0 {
        return Ok(false);  // No rows deleted, run_id was not found
    }

    // Return success if rows were deleted
    Ok(true)
}
