//! This module provides utility functions for parsing log lines in a structured way.
//!
//! The primary goal of the functions in this module is to extract meaningful
//! gameplay-related data from textual log lines and format them into structured,
//! reusable data types for further processing.
//!
//! Main functionalities include:
//! - Extracting and converting timestamps from log lines into a consistent format (`get_log_time`).
//! - Identifying and updating player-related information, such as the player's nickname
//!   and squad members (`handle_names`).
//! - Parsing and processing shield change events to track time and status effects (`shield_change_from_line`).
//! - Identifying and handling specific events like leg breaks and converting them to structured types (`leg_break_from_line`).
//!
//! This is used in conjunction with the `ParserState` that keeps track of prior state changes
//! and supports generating structured events like `Run`, `ShieldChange`, and `LegBreak`.
