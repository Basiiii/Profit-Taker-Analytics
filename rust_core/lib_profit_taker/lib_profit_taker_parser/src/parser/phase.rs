//! # Phase Parsing Utilities
//!
//! This module provides functions for managing and processing phases within a run. It includes
//! functionality for preparing phases, computing timings, resetting phase-specific variables, 
//! and processing runs after all phases have been parsed.
//!
//! ## Key Functions
//! - [`prepare_and_submit_phase`]: Handles phase termination and prepares the next one.
//! - [`run_ended`]: Finalizes run data and sets the appropriate parser state.
//! - Helper functions such as:
//!     - [`calculate_total_shield_time`]
//!     - [`calculate_total_leg_time`]
//!     - [`calculate_total_pylon_time`]
//!     - [`reset_phase_variables`]
//! - Post-processing logic to update total run times for debugging or finalization.

/// # Prepares the current phase for submission and starts a new phase.
///
/// This function handles the termination of the current phase by calculating
/// key metrics such as total time, shield time, leg time, body kill time, and
/// pylon time. After the phase metrics are calculated, the current phase is 
/// cloned and added to the list of phases for the current run. Subsequently, 
/// the parser state is reset and a new phase is initialized.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// - `line`: A reference to a string slice representing the current log line.
/// - `run`: A mutable reference to the current [`Run`] being parsed. 
///          This is where phases are stored.
/// - `parser_state`: A mutable reference to [`ParserState`] containing information
///                   about the current phase and the parser's state.
///
/// # Behavior
///
/// - Calculates and assigns the time-related metrics for the current phase.
/// - Appends the current phase to the provided `run`.
/// - Resets parser state variables pertaining to the phase.
/// - Initializes a new phase in the parser state.
