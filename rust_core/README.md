# Profit Taker Analytics - Rust Core Component

The **Rust Core Component** is a backend library designed to parse data from Warframe's **EE.log** files and manage SQLite databases. It provides the core functionality required for efficient data processing and storage, with high performance and reliability.

## Overview

This component is written in **Rust** and serves as the foundation for parsing and analyzing data related to the **Profit Taker** in Warframe. It handles the extraction of relevant data from **EE.log** files and manages storage in an SQLite database.

### Key Features

- **EE.log Parsing**: Efficiently parses Warframe's **EE.log** files to extract relevant information for Profit Taker speedruns.
- **SQLite Database Management**: Manages storage of parsed data in an SQLite database, ensuring fast and reliable access.
- **High Performance**: Built in **Rust** for maximum performance and efficiency during data processing.
